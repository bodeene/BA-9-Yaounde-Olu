<h1 style="text-align:center">Yaoundé Olu</h1>
<p>Yaoundé Olu (also known as Dr. Joyce P. Bowen), is a multimedia artist, cartoonist, musician, and educator who has advocated for the arts and education since her career began in 1960s Chicago. She founded the pathbreaking Osun Gallery in 1968 and continued as its director into the early ‘80s. As a cartoonist, she has won four Best Editorial Cartoon awards to date.</p>
<p>Her works of visual art have been described as "imaginative compositions that combine tribal African designs and symbols with sleek,futuristic imagery, with totemic figures adorned with patterns and immersed in fields of color."<a href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Although many have described her work as afrofuturist, she prefers to describe what she does as a form of retrofuturism.</p>

<p>In this interview excerpt, Olu describes the importance of art in her early childhood and teenage years, as well as her experience as a woman in predominantly male professional and artistic spaces.</p>
