12.088814	19.487433	We're speaking with Yaounde Olu. Hi Yaounde.
19.487433	20.081965	Hi.
22.129797	28.47147	Now. Once upon a time, there was a girl named Joyce Bowens, right?
28.47147	32.10472	Joyce Bowen. B-o-w-e-n.
33.095606	37.719743	And she was born somewhere at some time, presumably. When did that take place?
37.719743	43.334766	Well, Joyce Patricia Bowen was born November 15, 1945.
43.665061	44.589889	Where?
44.589889	46.241366	In Chicago, Illinois.
46.637721	48.69381	I see. And what did she do then?
50.048022	52.112368	She began to observe the world around her.
52.971136	57.281492	This is good. And I'm sure that she came up with some interesting observations.
58.338438	63.391959	Yes, she did. She found life to be very strange and interesting. 
66.348103	67.99958	Mmhmm. Yes?
69.469395	80.327859	And um... birth to me was like-- just a minute, do you want it to be this...? I mean, I'm, you know...
81.607754	82.507809	Speak your mind.
82.895906	84.357464	Wait, turn-- turn that off for a minute.
87.008085	110.888448	My earliest experiences, in terms -- you know, with life, were very interesting. And they filled me with a desire to experience life in its fullest. You know, and gave me a positive attitude to try to do as best as I possibly could in life, in whatever it was that I wanted to do. I felt this very early in life.
113.225288	122.902945	I see. And when did your artistic tendencies begin to really-- When did you become aware of your artistic tendencies?
123.563536	149.392642	Well, my mother says that-- well, she has a drawing that I did when I was two years old. A recognizable baby buggy, she said it was really a baby buggy. And I think she still has it. But that was the first drawing I did. But I would like to say that I was influenced a great deal by my father too. My mother and my-- my parents are very interested in, you know, they like art.
149.392642	166.601036	And my father was an artist. He wanted to be an artist, but he ended up with children, so he settled for doing other things, and sacrifices art. And that's why he has encouraged me to pursue art.
166.601036	185.460908	He did murals of Popeye and Olive Oyl and people like that on my walls when I was a child, like two years old. So that was a great influence on me. You know, having art around me -- watching him, you know, actually paint and draw.
186.187558	187.839035	And then I stick my hand in the water.
188.697804	198.738786	Yes, well that's probably what it was there for. Anyway. So now, we have the two year old drawing -- the painting at two. Do you still have it?
199.432406	204.122602	I think my mother has it. She keeps, she tells me about it but I haven't even looked at it.
204.122602	206.071345	What media is it in? What does it look like?
206.071345	225.45969	It's probably pencil. Probably pencil or crayon. I'm gonna have to ask her about that. I should have, you know, I've been meaning to ask her. We never, I never get a chance to talk about it now. But she says that somewhere she has a drawing of a recognizable baby buggy that I did at age two.
225.988162	234.047372	This is extremely interesting. But now could we move on and see, when did the next little artistic happening develop?
235.797938	256.540494	Well, as a child I always like to create. I lived quite a bit in my imagination: Moon in Pisces [inaudible] in Sun and Scorpio in Saturn. But I had a fantastic imagination. And I was always creating.
257.663498	286.465264	And I was always inspired by others around me who were creating. So I used to go to museums, you know, my parents would take us out, on outings. And I used to look at-- go to the library. I spent a lot of time in the library reading books about the old masters and you know, really getting off into the imaginary world of Botticelli and Tintoretto and those people, you know?
286.828589	289.206716	I don't know, but I'll take your word for it.
289.206716	305.424224	Well, they were early artists. And at that time, I was not aware of any significant Black art influences, So that's where my early experiences came from. The old European masters because that's what was available in the school libraries at the time.
305.853608	307.14176	Wouldn't it be more [inaudible]?
308.793237	312.723754	So what age were you when you were digging these European masters in the grammar school?
312.723754	314.144024	Nine, ten, eleven.
314.771586	316.489122	And were you painting and drawing then?
317.34789	320.386609	Yes, I was. In fact that I had a portfolio at age 11.
320.386609	321.575672	When, when--
321.575672	327.190695	Portfolio. You know, with a number of drawings neatly arranged and everything in place.
327.190695	329.502764	When did you start drawing seriously like that?
332.772689	350.245319	You know, all my life, whatever I've done, I've done it seriously. So whenever I drew, I drew seriously at school. Whatever I did, I did seriously. I'd like to add to this point, though, that I was just not into art by itself. Art provided a world of escape. A world of images and pictures.
350.245319	380.632503	And I had a very fertile imagination, and I enjoyed being in that world. But I also developed a lot of other interests when I was younger that I think also influenced my art. For example, I had a friend who was a tree, outside my window, very early in life. So, because of that, and because every spring, I would be able to watch this tree develop from bud to full-fledged, blossom-- blooming, a blooming plant or tree.
380.632503	412.20875	It gave me an appreciation for creation also, and an appreciation for nature. So, I've had a lot of other interests. I was an outdoor person. I liked sunshine, I liked all kinds of sports and what have you. I wasn't the quiet kind of little girl who sat at home all the time. I enjoyed being outside and experiencing life. It was not all roses, of course, but it was all intense.
412.9354	421.853378	I see. So in other words, with that drawing at age two, you've been drawing-- just as all children draw-- you've been doing this all your life. This one mode of expression has been with you all your life.
421.853378	424.099387	Right, right, it is.
425.552687	433.083424	You had a portfolio at age 11. Characterize a little bit of your development for us over your teen years.
434.933079	460.762184	Well during my teen years, I lost my intense desire to be with nature as much as I had, as opposed to my earlier years. But my adolescent years were very physical years. I remember, you know, discovering what it meant to be a girl.
460.762184	480.117499	At that point, I began to-- my body began to change, so I began to view the world around me differently. And my interests began to be centered upon personality and human relationships and, you know, early romance, things like that.
481.488225	483.519543	Do you want me to talk about these things?
483.816808	499.73705	Yes, well romance is obviously an important part of life, and it ties up our emotions and may be closely related to creativity. YaoundÃ©, I wanted to ask you, you discovered what it meant to be a girl, a woman. What does it mean?
502.313355	526.424924	Well, at that time I was learning more, not just what it meant to be a girl psychologically and spiritually, because I'm still learning that today. But I'm talking about learning the ritual that most human beings go through in order to be acculturized. 
526.689161	528.20852	A socialization process.
528.20852	528.93517	Exactly.
529.265466	530.520588	An acculturation process.
530.520588	538.645857	Right. For example, girls don't stand on the corner. You know, girls don't hang in the schoolyard with the boys after dark.
538.645857	543.600289	Where did you pick up these values from? From observed behavior or from an older relative?
543.930585	561.964717	To be perfectly honest and truthful I do not know. Subliminal influences are around us continually. So, it's not always-- I don't think we're always conscious of the machine input that we automatically respond to continually.
561.964717	579.536436	So we develop, you know, these roles that just absorb, I mean, the role concepts are absorbed and we respond automatically based on patterns that were established earlier. You know, based on that big-T "Tradition". You see. 
579.536436	588.520473	I see. When did you first start to publicly display your works and gain your present community stature?
588.982887	606.554606	Well, like I said, my teen years were more concerned-- were dealing more with my physical and social development. But in high school I went through a number of changes in terms of trying to decide what I was going to do.
606.554606	632.053417	I had an academic-- I was in the academic curriculum, but I qualified for what they called Art Major. So I had Art Major. And, but I developed a fantastic interest in science and also in music. In fact I got a little-- I won the John Phillip Sousa Award, which was one of the highest awards you could get at that time. In elementary school-- I mean, in high school, for music.
